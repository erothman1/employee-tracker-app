# employee-tracker-app

## Description 
I built this project because I was motivated to create a command-line application that would allow a business owner to keep track of their employees, departments, and roles in a simple and intuitive way. This application allows the user to add new departments, add new roles, add new employees, update employees, and view the departments, roles, and employees in the format of readable tables. Throughout the development of this application, I learned how to use MYSQL and the npm package of mysql2. I sourced schemas and seed data while also writing database queries with Node.js. Furthermore, I used two other npm packages: inquirer and console.table.

## Usage 
To use this application, you must git clone this repository to your local computer. Navigate to the repository through the terminal. 
Once, you've done that, type in the following command to beging using the application:

```bash
node index.js
```

Here is a video of me walking through the steps to use this application
